                <p>Hi, I'm Tadila Castro, a Brazilian UX/UI Designer trying to create better experiences for people.
                </p>
                <p>I have been working in the IT field for 6 years as a Business Analyst supporting automation
                    procedures. I also have a passion for learning about cultures and languages and now look for ways to
                    combine these skills and interests to help people engage with new technologies. </p>

                    <h3>I'm the MAKER | Commited to my craft.</h3>
                    <div class="personalityType">
                        <h4>Creative Strengths</h4>
                        <p>Focus and dedication, ability to achieve mastery.</p>
                        <h4>Personality</h4>
                        <p>Driven, focused, and dedicated to the creative process, the MAKER has mastered the art of
                            manifesting ideas and visions in three-dimensional form. Society greatly benefits from the
                            work
                            of MAKER types, who develop the systems, structures, tools, and innovations that the rest of
                            us
                            rely on.</p>
                        <p>One of the hardest workers of all the types, the MAKER is almost always busy solving
                            problems,
                            making headway on personally meaningful goals, and completing projects. There are few things
                            that bring this person more satisfaction than applying her brain power to crafting things
                            and making
                            progress in any form. The MAKER tend to excel in design, crafts, architecture, and other
                            fields that
                            blend artistry with business and technology.</p>
                        <p>The MAKER is driven by tangible results, and knows how to deliver.</p>
