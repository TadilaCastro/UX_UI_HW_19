                <p>Hi, I'm Tadila Castro, a Brazilian UX/UI Designer trying to create better experiences for people.
                </p>
                <p>I have been working in the IT field for 6 years as a Business Analyst supporting automation
                    procedures. I also have a passion for learning about cultures and languages and now look for ways to
                    combine these skills and interests to help people engage with new technologies. </p>
            </div>

                    <p>I'm the MAKER | Commited to my craft.</p>
                    <p>Creative Strengths: Focus and dedication, ability to achieve mastery.</p>
                    <p>Untapped Potential: Taking creative risks, finding joy and play in the process.</p>
                    <p>Ideal Collaborator: The Visionary</p>
                    <p>Driven, focused, and dedicated to the creative process, the MAKER has mastered the art of manifesting ideas and visions in three-dimensional form. Society greatly benefits from the work of MAKER types, who develop the systems, structures, tools, and innovations that the rest of us rely on.</p>    
                    <p>One of the hardest workers of all the types, the MAKER is almost always busy solving problems, making headway on personally meaningful goals, and completing projects. There are few things that bring you more satisfaction than applying your brain power to crafting things and making progress in any form. You tend to excel in design, crafts, architecture, and other fields that blend artistry with business and technology.</p>
                    <p>You’re driven by tangible results, and you know how to deliver. A quiet type, you enjoy collaboration but generally prefer to work alone so you can focus on your own creative process.</p>
                    <p>You know how to play the long game, and you’re not afraid to do the unglamorous legwork that goes into building something of value over time. Your gifts of focus and dedication can lead to achieving mastery and coming to be seen by others as an authority in your field.</p>
                    <p>Your biggest challenge? To connect more deeply with your intuition and emotions in order to bring forth ever more authentic and original work. Productivity is only half the equation of doing great work—the other half is inspiration. Creating the space to dream, imagine, and play can keep your work from becoming rote and mechanical.</p>
                    <p>Combine forces with the enterprising VISIONARY to take your creativity to new heights. The VISIONARY’s soaring imagination gives you permission to dream bigger and envision the impossible—and to fearlessly risk failure in order to make it a reality.</p>
